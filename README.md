# Cerium
Part II Project at the University of Cambridge - an incremental type checker for a subset of C using DDlog. 
A full description of the project can be found in the accompanying [dissertation](dissertation.pdf). Highly experimental at the moment so especially the tree differencing is not entirely correct (especially in edge cases since sufficient testing is missing).
