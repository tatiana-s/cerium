This example program is based on Project Euler solutions from the "TheAlgorithms/C" repository distributed under the GPL license (see https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/tree/master/project_euler). 

They are modified in order to adhere to the feature set the type checker supports and therefore semantically don't have the original meaning.

The license and source is included in this extra file because the actual code examples can't include comments because they are not currently supported by the parser interface.

The problem solutions (with link to base code) included are:
- problem 1 (https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/blob/master/project_euler/problem_1/sol1.c)
- problem 2 (https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/blob/master/project_euler/problem_2/so1.c)
